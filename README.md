### Singapore MRT Route Finder

This project models the Singapore MRT system using a graph data structure and computes both the shortest path (fewest stops) and the fastest path (based on estimated travel time) between stations.

## Features

- Loads MRT station data from CSV
- Constructs a graph using station codes as nodes
- Calculates shortest route (fewest stops)
- Calculates fastest route (estimated travel time)
- Handles transfers and loop lines (e.g., Circle Line)

## How to Use

1. Place `stations.csv` in the folder.
2. Download required libraries from "requirements.txt".
